## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `hashicorp_release` role: installs a HashiCorp binary from
  releases.hashicorp.com, verified against the published SHA256SUMS. Compares
  the installed version, so a version bump upgrades in place.
- `consul` role: server or client agent with gossip encryption, TLS and ACLs
  with `default_policy: deny`. Agent keys are generated on the node and only
  a signing request reaches the controller. Every secret (CA, bootstrap token,
  agent tokens, gossip keys) can be given as a value from any store; what is
  not given is minted once into files on the controller. Agent tokens use the
  node's built-in identity. The plain HTTP port is off; the API is HTTPS only.
- `vault` role: Vault on integrated raft storage, TLS only, bound to one
  address. Initialises once, writing the unseal keys and root token to a file
  on the controller, and refuses to initialise when that file already exists.
  Unseals a sealed Vault on every run. Restarts on a new binary.
- `tls_certificate` role: a node certificate signed by a CA held on the
  controller, with the key generated on the node. Used by `consul` and
  `vault`.
- `consul_keyring` module: converges the gossip keyring to a declared list,
  primary first. Rotation is two runs, `[new, old]` then `[new]`. Supports
  check and diff mode; the diff names keys by a hash prefix, never the key.
